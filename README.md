This is an assignment containing four exercises, three of which have to do with animation, motion, and
collision. In the first exercise, comments are made throughout the program to tell line by line what
is happening in the code. In the second exercise, comments are made on the section of the code that has to
do with the collisions of the balls. The third exercise had me include the jumping animation from the 
provided sprite sheet. Finally the fourth exercise taught me how to include audio such as music and sound
effects into my code.
